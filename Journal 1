This week I used AI to help generate possible ideas for my group project charter. We worked
together to come up with ideas and worked together to use our resources on generating 
possible ideas and functions we could use within our project for the semester. I also used AI
to help clear erros within my code and hep me clean and organize my code whenever I write it.
