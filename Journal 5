This week I used AI to help me with a few of the week 5 exercises and I also used AI to help
me correct any simple errors that I made within my code in the exercises. I asked AI to help
me clean the code so it was more organized. My group and I also used AI to help clean our 
code for the project and we used AI to generate some ideas within our project and code.
